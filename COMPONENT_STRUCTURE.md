## üìÅ Component Organization

### Layout Components (`/src/components/layout/`)
- **Navigation.tsx** - Fixed navigation with active section tracking
- **Footer.tsx** - Simple footer with copyright

### Section Components (`/src/components/sections/`)
- **Hero.tsx** - Landing section with introduction and CTA
- **About.tsx** - Executive summary section
- **Highlights.tsx** - Key highlights with icons and descriptions
- **Experience.tsx** - Professional journey timeline
- **Research.tsx** - Internships and research experience
- **Projects.tsx** - Innovation and key projects showcase
- **Skills.tsx** - Technical skills organized by category
- **Education.tsx** - Educational background and coursework
- **OtherExperience.tsx** - Additional experience and community involvement
- **Contact.tsx** - Contact information and social links

### UI Components (`/src/components/ui/`)
- **AnimatedSection.tsx** - Reusable animation wrapper components

### Utilities (`/src/lib/`)
- **animations.ts** - Centralized animation variants and configurations

## üéØ Benefits of This Structure

### ‚úÖ **Maintainability**
- Each section is isolated and self-contained
- Easy to modify individual sections without affecting others
- Clear separation of concerns

### ‚úÖ **Reusability**
- Animation components can be reused across sections
- Consistent animation patterns throughout the app
- Shared animation variants in one place

### ‚úÖ **Readability**
- Main App.tsx is now clean and easy to understand
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Clear import structure

### ‚úÖ **Scalability**
- Easy to add new sections
- Simple to modify existing sections
- Component-based architecture supports future enhancements

### ‚úÖ **Performance**
- Components can be lazy-loaded if needed
- Smaller bundle sizes per component
- Better tree-shaking opportunities

## üöÄ Usage

The main App.tsx now simply imports and renders each section component, making it extremely clean and maintainable:

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-background">
      <Navigation />
      <Hero />
      <About />
      <Highlights />
      <Experience />
      <Research />
      <Projects />
      <Skills />
      <Education />
      <OtherExperience />
      <Contact />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## üé® Animation System

All animations are centralized in `/src/lib/animations.ts` and reused through the `AnimatedSection` and `AnimatedItem` components, ensuring consistency across the entire portfolio.

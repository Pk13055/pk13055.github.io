# Authenticity is like a Photograph

## The Aperture

A faint absurdity hangs over any attempt to read or write online now. The medium has trained us into a new kind of vision—one that scans not only for meaning but for provenance. We no longer ask *what* a sentence is saying before we ask *who* or *what* shaped it. The uncanny no longer belongs to faces alone; it lives in paragraphs that are a little too symmetrical, insights that arrive with the soft click of an algorithm rather than the staggered breath of a mind thinking its way forward.
Authenticity has become a photograph: a moment of truth that requires very specific lighting to exist at all. And like real film pushed to its limits, it rarely appears in high definition. It shows itself through grain, through uneven exposure, through the shadows where detail collapses but emotion deepens. In a landscape increasingly engineered for immaculate clarity, the imperfections are the only convincing signs of life.


## Depth of Field

There was a time when the internet had depth—a sense of place, a sense of background, a sense that the subject belonged to a larger and unruly world. Now the background has collapsed into a soft bokeh, a blur produced not by artistry but by scale. Everything arrives pre-lit, pre-stabilized, pre-optimized. The accidental shadows that once gave the web character have been replaced by presets that promise uniform brightness regardless of context.
AI widened the aperture far beyond what the sensor can truly handle. It democratized competence and homogenized expression in the same gesture. The result is a landscape saturated with work that is technically impeccable yet culturally hollow: a field of perfectly focused foregrounds floating over backgrounds made of noise. We scroll through ideas the way one scrolls through stock imagery—pleasant enough, but interchangeable, lacking the jagged specificity that once defined digital subcultures and individual creators.
In this haze, the human outlier becomes the only reliable point of focus. The strange phrase, the inelegant transition, the crack of personal risk—these are the edges that refuse to blur.

## The Over-Exposed Image

Over-exposure isn't just too much light; it's the erasure of what light is meant to reveal. When every creator uses the same tools, the same optimizations, the same generative scaffolding, the highlights blow out. Detail vanishes. Ideas bleach into sameness.
We are surrounded by work that is flawless in the way a showroom photograph is flawless: balanced histograms, polished contours, no deep blacks, no daring whites. The tragedy is quiet but unmistakable. An image may still be beautiful, but it ceases to belong to anyone. It becomes an artifact without a maker.
This is the great irony of algorithmic creativity: it reproduces the *surface* of art while smoothing away the accidents that give a piece its internal life. Chromatic aberration—those tiny fringes of color a real lens can't quite reconcile—aren't errors but evidence. They reveal that light met glass, that physics left fingerprints. Without those small failures, the resulting image is perfect in the way a mannequin is perfect: alluring, untouchable, lifeless.

## The Raw File

Reclaiming authenticity means returning to the Raw file—not as nostalgia, but as method. A Raw file is unwieldy, dark, and flat before processing. It holds more information than is visible at first glance. It contains possibilities a JPEG has already discarded.
The Raw file is the draft that rambles, the metaphor that strains, the opinion that risks being too specific to generalize. It's the odd syntax you didn't smooth out, the moment of vulnerability you didn't disguise. Noise, in this sense, is not a defect but a signal—the grain of an actual encounter between thought and expression.
This is the territory where AI still cannot truly follow. It cannot chase a bad idea out of stubborn curiosity. It cannot contradict itself because it felt differently ten minutes ago. It cannot pursue an emotional tangent that derails the argument but exposes something true. It cannot leave behind the small irregularities that serve as evidence that a human held the camera.
When we allow our work to be tidied into perfect JPEGs, we compress not just our prose but our presence. And in doing so, we become harder to find—not just for readers, but for ourselves.

## The Frame

Every photograph is shaped as much by its edges as its subject. The frame declares what matters, what can be safely omitted, and what the viewer is invited to interpret for themselves. Algorithms have tried to standardize even this, nudging creators toward the same dimensions, the same compositional habits, the same easily digested narratives.
But framing remains the last domain that cannot be fully automated: the intention behind what the image includes and what it withholds.
Authenticity doesn't require rejecting the machine. You're reading this on a screen; I'm drafting it with the assistance of systems that are themselves part of the problem. Yet the point is not purity. The point is authorship. It's the difference between letting the tool refine your vision and letting it replace it.
In an era saturated with perfectly rendered facsimiles, the most compelling images will be the ones that show their seams—the fingerprints along the negative, the uneven development, the marginal notes that never expected an audience. These are the nuances that reveal the mind behind the lens, the subtle cues that signal someone was truly present when the shutter was pressed.
The landscape may be shifting, but the task remains what it has always been: to choose a frame that feels alive, and to let the grain stand.
